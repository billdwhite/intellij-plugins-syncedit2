=========

SyncEdit version 2 IntelliJ Plugin - Updated version of original SyncEdit plugin by Nathan Brown which has been abandoned since 2006.
This is an attempt to revive this plugin and get it working with versions 12 and higher.  With this plugin you can highlight a range
of code, then select a word and change it. Any corresponding instances of that word within the selected range will also be updated.
There is also a 'paste with SyncEdit' feature that activates upon the pasting results into the editor.  Additional information
